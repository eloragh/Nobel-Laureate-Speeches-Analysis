# Analyzing Nobel Peace Prize Speeches

## Description

Using NLTK and collections, I was able to easily parse through text files and iterate through the words within them. I created a dictionary that represents the
words most used by Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in their Laureate speech.

## Getting Started

* If you want to read the process of this analysis, I recommend looking at this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/eloragh/nobel_speeches_freq_analysis-1/blob/main/ns_speech_analysis_redo.ipynb).

### Dependencies

* [Install NLTK as well as NLTK.corpus.](https://www.nltk.org/install.html)
* [Download the folder of 29 text files that hold the Laureates speeches](https://github.com/eloragh/nobel_speeches_freq_analysis-1/tree/main/nobelspeeches).

### Installing

* To run from the command line, [download this .py file of the same analysis](https://github.com/eloragh/nobel_speeches_freq_analysis-1/blob/main/nobel_speech_analysis.py).
* Make sure to download the [folder of speeches](https://github.com/eloragh/nobel_speeches_freq_analysis-1/tree/main/nobelspeeches) as "nobelspeeches". 
* **This analysis assumes that both the .py file and folder of speeches are in the same directory.**

### Executing program

```
cd *insert your absolute path*
nobel_speech_analysis.py
```
